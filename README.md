# vscode-zeromq

This is an npm module for using zeromq binaries build in Azure Pipelines in a Node project. It is used by the [Jupyter Extension for VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter-internal).
The binaries can be found in the releases section of the [zeromq-prebuilt](https://github.com/microsoft/zeromq-prebuilt) repo.

# How it works

* The npm package `zeromq` is installed as a node dependency.
* This npm package is installed as a dev dependency.
* As part of the post install, the exported function `downloadZMQ` should be invoked as follows:
```typescript
const { downloadZMQ } = require('vscode-zeromq');
await downloadZMQ()
```
	* This will replace all of the binaries found in the `zeromq` module with the prebuilt binaries.


# Usage example
Run the following as a `postinstall` step

```typescript
const { downloadZMQ } = require('vscode-zeromq');
await downloadZMQ()
```
